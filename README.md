# Frankensteinian Bastardization of the Uniden Bearcat API

**Fair Warning:** I'm not a professional programmer. The purpose of this fork
 is to help me learn python skills by application. I'm basically tearing up
  this Uniden Bearcat API and trying to get it to work with the Uniden SDS
  -100. There are lots of mistakes and odd implementations, so just keep that
   in mind if you accidentally found this repo.
   
   I try to thoroughly comment my code, but that doesn't mean the comments
    will make much sense. So if you end up confused, it's not your fault!
